What can Linux learn from the others
====================================

Inspiration from Solaris
------------------------

.STREAM
* I/O subsystem that is modular and can be stacked one on top of another.

.Kernel stability
* In Solaris, you have just stable interfaces which are supported and not
  supposed to change, but everything beneath that can change.

.ZFS
* We are getting BTRFS

.Zones
* lightweight virtualization

.RBAC
* privilege granularity
* root is set of privileges
* anybody can be root
