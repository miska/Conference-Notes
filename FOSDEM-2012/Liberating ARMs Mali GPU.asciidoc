Everything is simple in x86 world, but nobody is taking serious look into ARM.
There is a lot of ARM vendors. Imagination (PowerVR), Nvigia, Qualcom, ARM
(Mali), ...

Mali 200
--------

Vertex(Geometry) processor, Fragment(Pixel) processor

Mali 400
--------

More Pixel processors and L2 cache

Current state
-------------

Kernel module is open source and working. 50% of user space is ESSL Compiler.
Rest is the infrastructure meant just to push data to the compiler.

To reverse engineer, use LD_PRELOAD and track open, ioctl and mmap

Limare
------

Prototyping only, driver is far in the future. Command stream build up and
interface with compiler works. Small, simple tests.

Create simple frame -> capture command -> replay it -> reduce thinks not needed stuff -> analyze the results -> try to fix it
