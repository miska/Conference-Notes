Main idea is to properly communicate it. Describe new solution, document
translation, create a lot of test cases. If you are going to do something like
that, prepare a good replacement, test idea with friends, prepare proof of
concept and ask people who are going to be impacted. Afterwards push it to the
mailing list and start a discussion.

Being ignored unless you have a code is pretty normal.
