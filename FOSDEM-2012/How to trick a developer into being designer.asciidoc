Designers are not crazy drunken guys. Prototyping is a good idea and shows, that
designers actually knows what are they doing.

Prototyping
~~~~~~~~~~~

Key to working with designers. While working with designers, you need frequent
iteration. It is important to make it easy for designers to try new code. You
can't be attached to the code, as designers like to throw it away. Even designs 
are getting thrown away. Don't ask designers to give simple advice, you'll end
up with new design for whole application. Prototyping will also help to talk to
each other and to appreciate designers more.
