Kernel Debugging
================

Kernel dumping is a hook, that allows to store the dump of the kernel and 
analyze it later. Dump can be analyzed later even on different machine. There 
are many tools to do so, but the best is kdump.

kdump
-----

There is a reserved memory, where second kernel is loaded. If kernel crashes, 
panic routine jumps to the second kernel, boots it up together with it's 
initrd, which stores dump to the disk and then reboots.

Crashdump
---------

Ordinary ELF core filee.

`crash`
-------

Tool based on gdb to analyze coredumps.

Setting things up
-----------------

Setting it up is easy - `yast2 kdump`. More memory you have, more memory needs 
to be reserved for kdump (4092M ~ 128M). There can bee a special kernel for 
kdump, possibly smaller. Make sure that there is `kexec` enabled, enough free 
space, `SysRq` enabled, debugging information for the kernel.

Meemory dump can contain sensitive data ;-)

`kdumptool`
-----------

Tool for creating dumps, but it is only one binary and it might be a little bit 
limited.

Virtual Machine
---------------

We can use hypervizor.

`crasher`
---------

Kernel module to crash kernel.
