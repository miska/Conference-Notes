Experience
----------

RedHat
~~~~~~

More levels of code review, first level is desirable to be done by new guys, experts focus on second level and actual work.

Drizle
~~~~~~

People submit pull requests, repository is automatically tested, then it is checked and integrated. Tip always works.

Python
~~~~~~

Every patch has to be ACKed or NACKed by the guy that is responsible for the area.

Evergreen
~~~~~~~~~

Sign-off process - every patch has to be signed off by somebody.

Several small projects guy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use github pull requests, bugs.

Webkit
~~~~~~

Uses Bugzilla for review project.

Jango
~~~~~

No paid developers, volunteers wants to have fun, not to review patches.

Overview
--------

 * providing feedback is importnt, even ENOTIME
 * code review has high priority - first thing to do before starting coding
 * showing statistics and queque on the web helps to motivate people to do the reviews
 * jenkins sound like a good tool
