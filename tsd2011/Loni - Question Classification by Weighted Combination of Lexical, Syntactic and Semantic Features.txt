Classification is a subsystem of question answering systems.

Query -> Query procession (reformulation) -> Document searching -> answer extraction -> Answering

Classification comes to play during Query processing. Extracts several
features, combines them and uses statistical classifier.

Features
--------

Types
~~~~~

* Lexical
** Unigrams
** Bigrams
** WH-words (what, where, wh.*)
** Word-shapes (lowercase, uppercase, ...)
* Syntactical
** Tagged unigrams
** Headwords (most important word of the sentence)
* Semantic
** Headword Hyphenyms (words higher in hierarchy of wordnet)
** Related words

Combining
~~~~~~~~~

* simple combination
* weighted combination
** better
** how to get weights

Training weights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Combining with unigram with various weights and obtaining the weights from
evaluating results of the combination.

Conclusion
----------

* some classes are harder to recognize
* wordnet can help
* weighting is a good idea instead of plain combination
