Final probability is probability from the acoustic model times probability of
language model. Problems can be in both models. We can get some acoustic
distortions or we can get new unknown words (or different language). As a
result, out of vocabulary words will get replaced with something that is in
the vocabulary and sounds similarly. This error also distorts the words around.
But these out of vocabulary words might have high information value. How humans
do deal with unexpected words? We adjust our models. We are processing words
and creating a prediction in the parallel and compare them. When these don't
match, we can reevaluate or react somehow. We can evaluate probabilities with
language model and without and if they differ too much, we are in trouble.

Processing of the speech seems to be multistream. In one stream we use language
model, in other we don't. We also use prior experience sometimes. But in the
general, there can be much more. In the end, we combine all streams. We will
get less errors but more false hits. Fletcher and colleagues divided the sound
into subbands (high frequency, low frequency, ...) and the error is the product
of the probability of error in each of subbands. In human brain, there are many
many different channels. So to emulate human brain better, we can have many
stream, that will get somehow combined, we evaluate the result and if we are
not happy, we recombine the streams inn different way and hope to get better
results.

So the future looks like a lot of parallel processing with multiple channels
containing not only voice data, but also all other possible information.
